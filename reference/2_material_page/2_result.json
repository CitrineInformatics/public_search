For example, you could utilize these datasets within Citrination to instantly estimate the hardness of any precipitate phase in any alloy system. These groups have invested hundreds of millions of CPU-hours running their carefully-tuned and automated simulations; Citrination puts the resulting insights in your hands.                      <strong>Records:</strong><br>69,640            <br><br>            <strong>Top properties:</strong>            <li>Enthalpy of formation</li>            <li>Band gap</li>            <li>Total magnetization</li>            ",

      "description": "This dataset contains data recently published by the thermoelectric wing of the Materials Project in Nature Computational materials and authored by Zachary Gibbs, Anubhav Jain, G. Jeffrey Snyder, et al. In this work, the authors identify and show that a new descriptor Nv*K* (called the Fermi surface complexity factor), a combination of the number of Fermi surface pockets (Nv*) and their anisotropy (K*), is highly effective in screening and ranking of potential thermoelectric materials. This is very advantageous as the calculation of this feature does not rely on the constant relaxation time approximation, and hence the scattering mechanism, which is hard to quantify. The data in this dataset includes the calculated value for this descriptor, the Seebeck and Boltztrap effective masses, etc for ~2,800 thermoelectric materials. The type of material, n-type or p-type, is listed as a property in a record.",
